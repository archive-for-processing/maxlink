:: MaxLink 0.33 installation instructions for Mac OS X ::


:: For Processing ::

   Drag the "Library-MaxLink" folder into your Processing examples folder
      (/Applications/processing-0085/examples/).
		
   Drag the "maxlink" folder into your Processing libraries folder
      (/Applications/processing-00xx/libraries).


:: For Max/MSP 4.5+ ::

   Drag the "jk" folder into the /Applications/MaxMSP 4.6/Cycling '74/java/classes folder.
		
   Drag the "p5-sketches" folder into the //Applications/MaxMSP 4.6/Cycling '74/ folder.	
				
   Add the line

      max.dynamic.jar.dir "/Applications/MaxMSP 4.6/Cycling '74/Cycling '74/p5-sketches" 

      to your max.java.config.txt file (in /Applications/MaxMSP 4.6/Cycling '74/Cycling '74/java).


Restart both apps.  

If you have a firewall running, enable network traffic on port 7474.

Check out the Processing examples from File:Sketchbook:Examples:Library-MaxLink.  Corresponding Max patches can be found in the "example max patches" folder.

It is no longer necessary to copy files into each sketch's code folder -- just add the library from the Processing application from Sketch:Import Library:maxlink.
